# Decentralized Mortgage System
# Objective
The project aims to create a decentralized mortgage system using Ethereum smart contracts.

# Smart Contract
Developed a Solidity smart contract called "Mortgage" to manage mortgage loans.


# Functionality
Users can submit loan requests, approve or decline loans, make payments, and withdraw remaining balances.
Tracks loan details such as loan amount, monthly payments, remaining balance, and homeowner's address.
Minimum Income Requirement
Implemented a requirement for a minimum monthly income for loan approval.

# Interest Calculation
Added an interest calculator to calculate interest on the loan amount.

# Late Fee Option
Included a late fee option for borrowers to pay late fees along with their payments.

# Streamlit Interface
Developed a Streamlit web interface for users to interact with the smart contract.

# Data Visualization
Displayed contract data such as homeowner address and loan amount using the Streamlit app.

# User Actions
Users can submit new loan requests, approve or decline loans, and make payments through the interface.

# Ethereum Integration
Connected the Streamlit app to a local Ethereum node to interact with the smart contract.

# Transaction Handling
Handled Ethereum transactions for loan submissions, approvals, declines, and payments.

# Error Handling
Implemented error handling to notify users of any issues during contract interactions.

# Testing
Tested the functionality of the smart contract and the Streamlit interface to ensure proper operation.

# Future Improvements
Potential future enhancements include adding additional security features, optimizing gas usage, and improving user experience.
